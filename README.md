# Markdown snippets for Jupyter in Voice-In Plus

This is a collection of about 90 voice snippets to support writing in markdown cells of Jupyter notebooks using the Voice In Plus plug-in for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge web browsers.  
The voice triggers and their associated text replacements are stored in the left and right  columns /CSV file.


1. Load the markdown.csv file by copying its contents and pasting these into the text area opened by double-clicking on the **bulk add** button on the configuration page for your Voice In Plus account.
2. Any existing voice commands with the same voice trigger (i.e., voice command in the left column) will be overwritten.
3. Convert an empty code cell into a markdown cell by entering `m`.
4. Activate the Voice-In plugin (I use the option-L key binding on my Mac).
6. Say the voice trigger to invoke the insertion of the corresponding code fragment.
7. Deactivate the Voice-In plugin (not always essential).
8. Hit Control-Enter to execute the markdown code block when ready to render it.
